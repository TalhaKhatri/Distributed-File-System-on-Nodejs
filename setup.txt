1. You need to have node installed on your system.
2. This works on linux systems since the file editor that the solution uses is gedit which is available on linux.
3. Do an 'npm install' to install the dependencies.
4. Start the proxy server in a terminal with 'npm run proxy'. This redirects clients to the actual servers.
5. Start the servers 0-2 using 'npm run server_A', 'npm run server_B', 'npm run server_C'
6. Start up the client process using 'npm run client'
5. Following are the valid commands:


ls                                          Lists all contents of the current directory. Directories show up in blue and Files show up in green.
mkdir <directory name>                      Creates a new directory.
cd <path>                                   Changes current directory to the specified path.
create <filename>                           Creates a new empty file in the current directory.
upload <file_path_on_client> <filename>     Uploads a file at the specified path on the client machine to the current directory in the file system with the specified name.
open <filename>                             Opens the file in a text editor and then pushes the updates to the filesystem.
